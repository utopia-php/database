# Contributing

We would ‚ù§Ô∏è for you to contribute to Utopia-php and help make it better! We want contributing to Utopia-php to be fun, enjoyable, and educational for anyone and everyone. All contributions are welcome, including issues, new docs as well as updates and tweaks, blog posts, workshops, and more.

## How to Start?

If you are worried or don‚Äôt know where to start, check out our next section explaining what kind of help we could use and where can you get involved. You can reach out with questions to [Eldad Fux (@eldadfux)](https://twitter.com/eldadfux) or anyone from the [Appwrite team on Discord](https://discord.gg/GSeTUeA). You can also submit an issue, and a maintainer can guide you!

## Code of Conduct

Help us keep Utopia-php open and inclusive. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Submit a Pull Request üöÄ

Branch naming convention is as following

`TYPE-ISSUE_ID-DESCRIPTION`

example:

```
doc-548-submit-a-pull-request-section-to-contribution-guide
```

When `TYPE` can be:

- **feat** - is a new feature
- **doc** - documentation only changes
- **cicd** - changes related to CI/CD system
- **fix** - a bug fix
- **refactor** - code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature

**All PRs must include a commit message with the changes description!**

For the initial start, fork the project and use git clone command to download the repository to your computer. A standard procedure for working on an issue would be to:

1. `git pull`, before creating a new branch, pull the changes from upstream. Your master needs to be up to date.

```
$ git pull
```

2. Create new branch from `master` like: `doc-548-submit-a-pull-request-section-to-contribution-guide`<br/>

```
$ git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

3. Work - commit - repeat ( be sure to be in your branch )

4. Push changes to GitHub

```
$ git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

5. Submit your changes for review
   If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.
6. Start a Pull Request
   Now submit the pull request and click on `Create pull request`.
7. Get a code review approval/reject
8. After approval, merge your PR
9. GitHub will automatically delete the branch after the merge is done. (they can still be restored).

## Creating A New Adapter

To get started with implementing a new adapter, start by reviewing the [specification](/SPEC.md) to understand the goals of this library. The specification defines the NoSQL-inspired API methods and contains all of the functions a new adapter must support, including types, queries, paging, indexes, and especially emojis ‚ù§Ô∏è.. The capabilities of each adapter are defined in the `getSupportFor*` and `get*Limit` methods.

### File Structure

Below are outlined the most useful files for adding a new database adapter: 

```bash
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src # Source code
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Database
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Adapter/ # Where your new adapter goes!
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Adapter.php # Parent class for individual adapters
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Database.php # Database class - calls individual adapter methods
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Document.php # Document class - 
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Query.php # Query class - holds query attributes, methods, and values
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tests
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Database
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Adapter/ # Extended from Base 
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Base.php # Parent class that holds all tests
```


### Extend the Adapter

Create your `NewDB.php` file in `src/Database/Adapter/` and extend the parent class:

```php
<?php

namespace Utopia\Database\Adapter;

use Exception;
use Utopia\Database\Adapter;
use Utopia\Database\Database;
use Utopia\Database\Document;
use Utopia\Database\Exception\Duplicate;
use Utopia\Database\Query;
use Utopia\Database\Validator\Authorization;

class NewDB extends Adapter
{
```

Only include dependencies strictly necessary for the database, preferably official PHP libraries, if available.

### Testing with Docker 

The existing test suite is helpful when developing a new database adapter. To get started with testing, add a stanza to `docker-compose.yml` with your new database, using existing adapters as examples. Use official Docker images from trusted sources, and provide the necessary `environment` variables for startup. Then, create a new file for your NewDB in `tests/Database/Adapter`, extending the `Base.php` test class. The specific `docker-compose` command for testing can be found in the [README](/README.md#tests).

### Tips and Tricks

- Keep it simple :)
- Databases are namespaced, so name them with `$this->getNamespace()` from the parent Adapter class.
- Create indexes for `$id`, `$read`, and `$write` fields by default for query performance.
- Filter new IDs with `$this->filter($id);`
- Prioritize code performance.
- The Query and Queries validators contain the information about which queries the adapters support.
- The [Authorization validator](/src/Database/Validator/Authorization.php) is used to check permissions for searching methods `find()` and `sort()`. Ensure these methods only return documents with the correct `read` permissions.
- The `Database` class has useful constants like types and definitions. Prefer these constants when comparing strings.

#### SQL Databases
- Treat Collections as tables and Documents as rows, with attributes as columns. NoSQL databases are more straight-forward to translate.
- For row-level permissions, create a pair of tables: one for data and one for read/write permissions. The MariaDB adapter demonstrates the implementation.

#### NoSQL Databases
- NoSQL databases may not need to implement the attribute functions. See the MongoDB adapter as an example.

## Other Ways to Contribute

Pull requests are great, but there are many other areas where you can help Utopia-php.

### Blogging & Speaking

Blogging, speaking about, or creating tutorials about one of Utopia-php‚Äôs many features is great way to contribute and help our project grow.

### Presenting at Meetups

Presenting at meetups and conferences about your Utopia-php projects. Your unique challenges and successes in building things with Utopia-php can provide great speaking material. We‚Äôd love to review your talk abstract/CFP, so get in touch with us if you‚Äôd like some help!

### Sending Feedbacks & Reporting Bugs

Sending feedback is a great way for us to understand your different use cases of Utopia-php better. If you had any issues, bugs, or want to share about your experience, feel free to do so on our GitHub issues page or at our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/GSeTUeA).

### Submitting New Ideas

If you think Utopia-php could use a new feature, please open an issue on our GitHub repository, stating as much information as you can think about your new idea and it's implications. We would also use this issue to gather more information, get more feedback from the community, and have a proper discussion about the new feature.

### Improving Documentation

Submitting documentation updates, enhancements, designs, or bug fixes. Spelling or grammar fixes will be very much appreciated.

### Helping Someone

Searching for Utopia-php, GitHub or StackOverflow and helping someone else who needs help. You can also help by teaching others how to contribute to Utopia-php's repo!
